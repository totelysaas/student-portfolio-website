Finally! It was the beginning of summer break, and my family and I were already going to go somewhere. This year, we would be visiting Yellowstone National Park, and since it's spread out between three states, we would be visiting Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.

First, we hopped onto a plane and went to Wyoming. From there, we drove to Idaho, which is actually pretty close to the airport. We stayed at a cool cabin with a basement. The main thing that stood out to me there was that there was a prairie-like setting with many spread out trailers and cabins. Most of the time, the place was peaceful, other than July 4th, when there would be fireworks and celebrations the whole night. The interesting thing was that instead of sleeping above ground, we slept in these bedrooms in the basement. 

The day after that, we visited our first National park, Grand Teton National Park. To me, this place seemed to be famous for its scenic mountains and rivers. We went on a hike there that took us through many rivers and waterfalls, which looked pretty cool. After walking for a while, we finally reached this interesting river. And then, after hiking up even more, we realized that the "river" we'd been looking at was actually a waterfall! Although it may seem that this journey took a short amount of time, it actually took us a whole day! On the way back, we passed a field filled with bison, which is definitely something you wouldn't commonly see in the Bay Area.

The next day, we went to one of the most famous national parks in America, Yellowstone! Since Yellowstone is famous for its springs and geysers, Old Faithful being the most infamous, we visited those areas the most. There were also some springs that looked like a pool filled with water. Although the springs varied in color and shape, the mud colors around each one remained the exact same.

And finally, we got to visit, after touring many springs and geysers, the infamous Old Faithful Geyser! After waiting for around an hour, we finally got to see the magnificent 150 feet geyser in action.

Because these national parks were spread out between 3 states, we rented a car and kept driving from one to another every day. On one of the days, between visiting different parks, we got to go horse riding on this sloped hill! Everyone got to pick their own horse and ride on a two-hour trail. Because of safety precautions, no one was allowed to bring any devices on the trip, so I don't have any pictures of us riding. 

And then, after visiting all these fun and historic sights, we hopped back onto a plane and flew back to home sweet home California.
