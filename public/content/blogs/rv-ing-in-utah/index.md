It was finally spring break, and we were going to be going to Utah! And then it got even better, we were going to be traveling in an RV! When we landed in Utah, we first went and picked up the RV we were renting for the week.

After getting settled in, we decided to visit one of the most famous national parks in Utah, Arches National Park! And the coolest thing about it was that it had a SUPER huge arch at the edge of a cliff that was a major sightseeing attraction. To get there though, we had to climb over this rocky patch filled with many tinier arches. We also had to cross this really thin ledge over the edge of the cliff, and it was really creepy, because there was a really steep drop if you fell. Once we reached the arch, I realized how ginormous it was, and the people looking at it looked so tiny!

The next day, we went to another national park that isn't as famous as Arches National Park. It was called Capitol Reef National Park. The most interesting thing to me there was that there was these 2 ridges that faced each other and in between, there was this really tiny gap. If you actually went there and saw this place in real life, it looked humongous!

The next day, we woke up early and headed to one of the best national parks in U.S, Bryce Canyon National Park! The first place we went to was Cannonville, a city in Bryce Valley. When we climbed the trek, we were able to see the whole park at an amazing view.

As we explored the park, there was these really interesting rock formations that formed these cool tunnels in the rock. 

My favorite part of the park was the Epic Slot Canyon. It's one of the world's longest and deepest slot canyons that goes on for miles but rarely gets wider than 20 ft. We were only able to go for around a mile before it got too narrow for us to squeeze through!

The next place we went to in the park was this sloped mountain, covered in all these interesting ridges and bumps. To climb to the top, we had to get down on all fours and climb up the whole slope that way! Even though it didn't look very steep, it was very easy to slip and fall.

The next day, we left Bryce Canyon and visited Springdale, and as you can tell by the name, the place was filled with springs, rivers, and lakes. We mainly just played near the rivers and tried to skip rocks in them. We also went on this hike that followed this huge gushing river. We also waded in the shallow parts of the river, because if we went too deep, then we would get swept away by the the powerful river. 

The next day, we visited Cove Fort, Historical Site. This rock fort was built in 1867 and protected telegraph lines and travelers on the road between Salt Lake City and the settlements further south.

The next day, we visited the capital of Utah - Salt Lake City! In the city, we visited Temple Square, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and recognizes the Mormon achievement in the settlement of Utah. That was the last day we spent in Utah, and after that, we returned the RV and headed back to home to the nearby state, California.
